‚è∫ File System Module Analysis

  The FS module is a SFTP-based file management system with the following architecture:

  üìÅ Core Components

  1. FsRepository (fs.repository.ts)
  - SFTP Client Management: Uses ssh2 library for SFTP connections
  - Connection Pooling: Automatic connection/disconnection with 1-hour TTL
  - Retry Logic: Built-in retry mechanism for failed operations
  - Root Path: All operations prefixed with /upload
  - Raw SFTP Operations: mkdir, rmdir, readdir, readFile, writeFile, unlink, rename

  2. FsService (fs.service.ts)
  - Business Logic Layer: Wraps repository with higher-level operations
  - Recursive Operations: Handles recursive directory creation/deletion
  - File Serving: MIME type detection and HTTP response handling
  - Fallback Support: Serves fallback files when original not found

  3. FsController (fs.controller.ts)
  - REST API: Full CRUD operations for files/directories
  - File Upload: Multipart file upload via FileInterceptor
  - Public Serving: Company-specific file serving at /fs/public/:companyId/*
  - Error Handling: Maps SFTP errors to HTTP status codes

  üîß Key Features

  Connection Management:
  - Auto-connect/disconnect with TTL (1 hour)
  - Connection retry on failures
  - Environment-based SFTP configuration

  File Operations:
  - ‚úÖ Read/Write files
  - ‚úÖ Create/Delete directories (with recursive support)
  - ‚úÖ Rename/Move nodes
  - ‚úÖ Directory listing (with recursive support)
  - ‚úÖ File upload via HTTP
  - ‚úÖ Public file serving with fallbacks

  Error Handling:
  - Custom exceptions for common SFTP errors
  - Proper HTTP status mapping
  - Connection timeout handling

  üóÑÔ∏è Database Integration

  The schema includes fsNodes table for metadata tracking:
  - id, name, type (enum: 'dir'/'file'), path, publicPath
  - size, file counts for directories
  - originalName, mimeType for files
  - Polymorphic associations via referenceableType/referenceableId
  - Standard audit fields

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

  1. No Database Sync: Repository operates directly on SFTP, schema table unused
  2. No Permissions: Controller has TODO for roles/permissions
  3. Manual Path Management: No automatic metadata tracking
  4. SFTP Dependency: Requires external SFTP server

  1. Update the Controller - Modify fs.controller.ts to extract user context from requests and pass it to the service methods
  2. Add Permissions/RBAC - The controller has a TODO comment about adding roles/permissions validation
  3. Implement Database Queries - Add methods to query files/directories from the database (not just SFTP)
  4. Add Public Path Management - Implement logic for the publicPath field in the schema
  5. Batch Operations - Add support for bulk file operations with proper database sync
  6. File Metadata Tracking - Enhance metadata tracking (file versions, checksums, etc.)
  7. Error Handling - Improve error handling for database sync failures
  8. Migration Tool - Create a tool to sync existing SFTP files to the database
